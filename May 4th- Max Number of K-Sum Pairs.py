You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.


SOLUTION:


class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        ans = 0
        while left < right:
            cur = nums[left] + nums[right]
            if cur == k:
                ans += 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif cur < k:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return ans
